I- Programming paradigm 
Object oriented program 
Object-oriented programming (Object-Oriented Programming - OOP) is an object-oriented programming technique, becoming a programming standard of today's advanced programming languages. The advantage of object-oriented programming is to reuse code, provide a clear structure of program modules, hide internal data, help programmers simplify the complexity of the lesson. math. 
Characteristics of object-oriented programming 
1.	Encapsulation: 
-	Packing is the process of keeping and hiding one or more components with a physical or logical package. In an object-oriented programming method, it prevents access to the internal deployment details of the object or a library. 
-	Packing is implemented using access specifiers (access specifiers). An access specification defines the scope and visibility of elements in the class. Keywords include public, private, protected, internal ... 
2.	Abstraction: 
Abstraction is a process of hiding deployment details and only displaying features to users. Abstraction allows you to eliminate the complexity of an object by only specifying the properties and methods needed by the object in programming. Abstraction helps you focus on the essential core of the object instead of taking care of how it performs. 
3.	Inheritance is the ability to allow us to build a new class based on the definitions of an existing class. The existing class is called the Parent class, the newly arising class is called the Child class and of course inherits all of the Cha class components, can share or extend the available properties without having to redefine. 
4.	Concept of polymorphism 
Polymorphism is the phenomenon that objects of different classes can understand the same message in different ways. 
An example of real polymorphism. We have 3 animals: dogs, cats, pigs. All three animals are animals. But when we tell all 3 animals to cry, the dog will whimper, the cat will meow and the pig will be flat. 
In the example above 3 animals: dogs, cats, pigs see as objects. The fact that we tell 3 animals to call is the message. It is clear that all 3 animals can understand the same message as calling in different ways. 
To show polymorphism: 
Classes must have inheritance relations with the same parent class. 
The polymorphic method must be override in subclasses Examples of object-oriented programming properties

The example shows that “Crile ": features inherited features such as" name "and "Color" from "Shape "
2.Procedural
1. Explain
What is Procedural Programming?
Procedural programming, also known as procedural programming, is the type of programming in which calculation in the program is based on estimating the values of procedures or procedures (including a set of different statements) in an order. determined from top to bottom.
Key features of procedural programming. focus on the work to be done (algorithm) Large program is divided into smaller functions Most functions use common data.
Data in the system is moving from one function to another.
The function transforms data from one form to another
Use a top-down approach to program design.
Example of procedural programming
Request: Write a program find the sum of numbers from 1 to 30.

3.Event – oriented programming
Event-driven programming is a method of building a system based on developing a graphical interactive interface across objects and defining system behavior through events of objects
EVENTS (continued)
•	Graphical User Interface (Graphic User Interface): is an interface that interacts with users through graphic objects.
•	The GUI is designed based on the basic object as a form and will put other objects into the form to suit the application.
•	Control (Control): is the object in the form, each object will have attributes, methods and events. For Example

Characteristic of event-driven programming
Service Oriented
Service oriented is a key feature in event-driven programming that used to write programs that are made for services and it takes does not slow down the computer as service oriented only consume little of the computer processing power and usually services run in the background of OS.
Time Driven
In event driven programming, time driven is a paradigm, it’s a code that runs on a time trigger, time driven can be a specific code that runs on a specific time, which could be once an hour, once a week or once a month, this means it’s a pre-set to do task. For example, windows update is the example of time driven, which user can set when to update or when to check and download the update.
Event Handlers
Event handlers is a type of function or method that run a specific action when a specific event is triggered. For example, it could be a button that when user click it, it will display a message, and it will close the message when user click the button again, this is an event handler.
Trigger Functions
Trigger functions in event-driven programming are a function that decide what code to run when there are a specific event occurs, which are used to select which event handler to use for the event when there is specific event occurred.
Events
Events include mouse, keyboard and user interface, which events need to be triggered in the program in order to happen, that mean user have to interacts with an object in the program, for example, click a button by a mouse, use keyboard to select a button and etc. (Event-
Driven Programming Features, 2017)
The relationship between procedural, object-oriented and event-driven programming
-	Procedural programming means that you define a program and its subprograms as a series of steps. In contrast, declarative programs try to describe the result without regard to the steps taken to the computer but rather some description or denotation of the desired result.
-	Object-oriented programming is a way of organizing code around the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, substitution, programming to interfaces, and so on. Object-oriented programs are usually mostly procedural.
-	Event-based programming is about writing event handling procedures and having the core event loop provided by the underlying system. In this way, you can save the trouble of writing your own event loop and benefit from various libraries that already work with the system provided the event loop. Event-based programs are very often writing using object-oriented style, but not always.
-	These three categories are thus not related strictly hierarchically, but in common usage, they are mostly nested within one another. (What are the relationships between programming procedural, object-oriented and event-driven paradigms?, 2017)
II. Integrated development environment
1. Definition
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is an integrated environment for software development, it is similar to other normal software but the purpose of IDE is to write source code.
Integrated development environments often include:
Integrated development environments often include:
*	A code editor (source code editor): used to write code.
*	Compiler and / or interpreter.
*	Automatic build tool: when using, it will compile (or interpret) the source code, implement linking, and can run the program automatically.
*	Debugger (debugger): support error detection.
*	In addition, it can include version management system and tools to simplify the construction of the graphical user interface (GUI).
*	Many modern unified development environments also integrate class browsers (object browsers), object inspector, class hierarchy diagram, ... for use in software development according to object orientation. By number of supported languages, we can divide widely used unified development environments into two categories:
*	Development environment integrates a language: working with a specific language, for example: Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 IDE.
*	Multi-lingual development environment: can work with many programming languages, for example: Eclipse IDE, NetBeans, Microsoft Visual Studio.
2. Features of IDE
Editing code
-	Like any other IDE, Visual Studio includes a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and finishing by using IntelliSense not only for functions, variables and methods but also for language structure such as query or control loop.
-	Debugger
Visual Studio has a debugger that features both machine-level debugging and source-level debugging. This feature works with both management code like machine language and can be used to debug applications written in languages supported by Visual Studio. - Design
Windows Forms Designer
Used for the purpose of building a GUI using Windows Forms, which are used to build internal controls or can lock them next to the template. Controls that present data can be linked to data sources such as databases or queries.
-	WPF Designer
This feature is similar to Windows Forms Designer, which supports metaphorical drag and drop. Use interaction between people and computers targeted at Windows Presentation Foundation.
-	Web designer / development
Visual Studio also has an editor and website design that allows websites to be designed with drag and object features.
